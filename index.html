            <h2 id="aboutMeTitle">About me</h2>
            <p class="aboutMeText">
                Hello, I'm an internet user from Romania, known by the nickname "Gordon_OmLiber".
                I'm interested in Front-End Development and I've been a programming hobbyist since
                the late summer of 2023.
            </p>

            <h2>My programming journey</h2>
            <p class="aboutMeText">
                I've seen my first programming impression with Python, which I studied for 10
                months: from August 8 2023, to June 8 2024. After that, I began with Front-End
                Development. I coded HTML for 2 weeks, then I learned CSS alongside HTML for an
                additional 2-3 weeks. On top of that, I learn to program in JavaScript as of writing
                this text.
            </p>
            <h2>What this hobby taught me</h2>
            <p class="aboutMeText">
                For me, I think programming is the skill I spent the most dedication and interest to
                in my life. If I wouldn't get out of my confort zone and try it, I couldn't see what
                a cool activity this is for me. By studying programming, of course I would also
                learn other stuff related to tech; like how computers work, and I even got upon
                documentation about Linux and why I should use it if I'm interested in programming.
                Then, by installing Linux, I learned more and more about tech.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="aboutMeText">
                Well, you see... By diving deep into a hobby, you can learn a lot more than you
                might think. And that's not just for programming; it could be anything. So get a
                hobby if you haven't already. You may find yourself and change your perspective of
                the world.
